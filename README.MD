## The Goal
During the bootcamp lesson we had a challenge to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in JavaScript. Due to limited time, we could not finish the challenges. I decided to finish the game in my own time, and I hope you enjoy it.

### End Results
The HTML and the CSS is written by me, which was a good refresher, while the JS is heavyly reasearched. It was a good way to get into bug fixing as I encountered many.
